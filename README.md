# CBScript
My Custom Language

## Usefulness?
It's probably the slowest language on the block, takes extra long to compile, and requires multiple bits of software to even work. Still cool since I made it.

## Dependencies
To Build a CBScript program, you need a few things.
- Java JDK >> A runtime of at least Java 8.
- Maven >> The latest Maven directory, with Java linked to it. This directory is needed to be parsed as you run the compiler

## How it works
It takes a CBScript project, and compiles it into a Maven Java software, which then is built as a jar.

## Running
Run the Java program through console. `java -jar CBScript-(version).jar PATH/TO/PROJECT PATH/TO/MAVEN_HOME`
It should compile, and the jar should end up in the project target folder.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork and Send a PR, i'd love to see what anyone can contribute.

## Coolness Factor
This language was also rewritten in CBScript itself like all the cool languages.
